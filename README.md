## Azure App Service And Function App

 

### Analyze Costs:

- App Service offers a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, meaning you don't need to worry about underlying infrastructure management.

- Costs are based on the plan you choose (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, etc.) and the resources you need, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

- You only pay for the resources you consume, and the scaling model can help you optimize costs based on demand.

 

### Scalability:

- App Service allows auto-scaling based on predefined metrics, such as CPU usage, or on a schedule. This helps your application handle varying workloads efficiently.

- Scaling is done automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention and allowing for seamless growth.

 

### Availability:

- App Service automatically load balances incoming traffic across multiple instances, improving availability and performance.

- It provides built-in disaster recovery and backup options, ensuring high availability of your application.
